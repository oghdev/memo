# Contributing to ðŸ’Œ memo

## How can I contribute?

### Improve documentation

We'd love if you suggested or implemented improvements to **memo**! Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, more examples, etc - every little helps!

Open issues for anything that could be improved. Anything. Even improvements to this document.

### Improve issues

Some issues are created with missing information, not reproducible, or plain invalid.

Help make them easier to resolve. Handling issues takes a lot of time that we could rather spend on fixing bugs and adding features.

### Give feedback on issues

We're always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker. It's a good way to help the maintainers prioritise issues, bugs and features that the community wants to see!

#### Thanks!
